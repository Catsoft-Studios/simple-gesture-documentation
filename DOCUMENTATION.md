# Introduction

**Simple Gesture** is a Unity plugin that allows developers to easily detect gestures for touch-screen devices in just one line of code. It can be easely integrated in any project, as it works with both C# and UnityScript.

# Getting Started

First of all, you will have to download the package from the AssetsStore. Once you have dowloaded and imported the assets you will need to configure... no, wait. That's all! :D

# Using SimpleGesture class

If you open the *SimpleGesture* main folder you will see a bunch of folders that contain other folders, with scripts and more scripts. For the moment, just forget about it. All you need to know is that there's a class called SimpleGesture, and this is everything you'll need.

## Hello World!
